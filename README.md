Excel is one of the most important programs Mícrosoft offers. A part of the Mícrosoft 365 (formerly called Office 365) suite, Excel is a spreadsheet program with a seemingly vast array of features and capabilities. Not only is Excel a way to store and organize information into cells and sheets, but it's a "what if" machine, able to quickly perform all manner of calculations with that data.

If you're new to Mícrosoft Excel, this article is for you. Here you'll find how to get started with Excel - everything from performing simple calculations to making pivot tables to specifying custom print areas and customizing your view.If there are spreadsheets you use often, you can pin them here on this Home screen so they're easier to find (right-click a spreadsheet in the "Recent" or "Shared with Me" list and choose "Pin to List").

If you don't want any existing template or Excel file, choose "Blank workbook."

After you're on Excel's main interface, let's take a quick look around and review some of the most common terminology.

An Excel document is referred to as a workbook. A workbook is a spreadsheet that is composed of one or more worksheets - by default, a new workbook opens with a single worksheet. You can add additional worksheets to a workbook using the plus "+" sign at the bottom of the screen, and switch among them using the tabs. Each sheet can be named (double-click in a tab to type a new name) and worksheets can be deeply connected with one another. For example, Sheet1 can use data stored on Sheet2 for a calculation.

Also at the bottom of the screen, on the right side, you'll see icons to change the view - you can see print previews of the spreadsheet, for example, and use the zoom slider to change the size of the spreadsheet on your screen.

Every worksheet is composed entirely of a grid of cells. Cells are identified by their X and Y coordinates, such as A1 and C33. You're unlikely to ever run out of cells; Excel supports a maximum of 1,048,576 rows and 16,384 columns.

At the top of the page, you'll find Excel's main controls in the ribbon. The ribbon is divided into tabs (such as Home, Insert, Draw, Formulas, and Data) with the most important features appearing in the ribbon for each of those categories. You can also perform some operations using the right-click menu (right-click on a cell or range of cells to see the available options).

## How to Enter Data Into Your Worksheet ? 

Entering data into worksheet cells is always a three-step process; these steps are as follows:

1. Click on the cell where you want the data to go.
2. Type the data into the cell.
3. Press the Enter key on the keyboard or click on another cell with the mouse.

As mentioned, each cell in a worksheet is identified by an address or cell reference, which consists of the column letter and number of the row that intersect at a cell's location. When writing a cell reference, the column letter is always written first followed by the row number – such as A5, C3, or D9.

When entering the data for this tutorial, it is important to enter the data into the correct worksheet cells. Formulas entered in subsequent steps make use of the cell references of the data entered now.
